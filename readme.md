#Boxes

Mainstream frameworks like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) are great for quick prototyping but not for production. They are littered with `!important`s and specificity issues, which makes it hard to achieve writing modular, extensible, scalable CSS. 

**Boxes** was made because there is a lack of modular, extensible, scalable CSS frameworks. It's modelled after learnings from OOCSS and my own experience.
