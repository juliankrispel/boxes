#Boxes
##A modular CSS/Sass framework

Boxes is a versatile CSS framework written in Sass. 

It wants to be completely configurable, extensible and scalable, as well as powerful and easy to set up. To achieve that it needs to:

- Avoid CSS specificity at all costs.
- Seperate mixins from markup and make each optional.
- Provide good documentation.


##Todo

- Look into a list option for buttons [using lists like dictionaries](https://gist.github.com/nathos/1212291)
- Add a make file that sets up a project
